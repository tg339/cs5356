Political Survey App
--------

This is a project idea. No work has been started on this project yet.

### Background
 Local governments are more flexible then their federal or state counterparts and can react much quicker to constituent opinion. However, local governments lack the resources or expertise needed to set up their own polls in order to understand their constituents opinions.

### Challenge
 I propose making a political survey app. It would collect people's opinions on local issues and provide that information to local government. In return the user would be able to see an aggregated view of other's opinions on the subject.

 A secondary service that this app could provide would be as a one stop shop for obtaining information on current local issues.
